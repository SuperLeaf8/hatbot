GENERAL:
    ☐ Change things into embeds (start with the queue control, there is a thumbnail_url attribute for Youtube objects)
    ✔ fix flag guess game @done(23-08-21 22:21)
    ☐ async stuff as much as we can because its good [blocking](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)
        - this means aiohttp, pytube async, aiofiles, async for (at least try)
    ☐ help command. IMPORTANT
    ☐ remember `outer`? we may be able to get rid of this by creating an instance of the view outside of the ctx.send function. check `mod.py` modmail
    ☐ when using UI, use own async functions so regular commands work too
    ☐ help cmd shows arg. (req and opt)

MUSIC:
    ☐ switch to pytube async? [link](https://libraries.io/pypi/async-pytube)
    ☐ only people who used the command should be able to control the music
    ☐ embeds for playing music refer to previous TODO section
    ☐ disable command for server when working on playing (play function)
    ☐ BUG: replays after using stop command

MOD:
    ☐ make it so people with similar or smaller role tiers in hiearchy cant do action on another user
    ☐ mod logs
    ☐ mod mail (make it so bot sees mutual servers and lets you choose using menu maybe? (definitely))
    ☐ setup commands for modmail and modlogs (create system for server config?)
    ☐ check if bad words are similar

NOTES:
    - soo since we are using inner and outer classes (bad idea, but we have to for the structure of the commands), we need to use different instances of "self" in order to have the inner class (ui.View) be able to use the outer class attributes (commands.Cog) send help

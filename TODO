GENERAL:
    ☐ Change things into embeds (start with the queue control, there is a thumbnail_url attribute for Youtube objects)
    ✔ fix flag guess game @done(23-08-21 22:21)
    ☐ async stuff as much as we can because its good [blocking](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

MUSIC:
    ☐ switch to pytube async? [link](https://libraries.io/pypi/async-pytube)
    ☐ only people who used the command should be able to control the music
    ✔ edit message when auto moving queue @done(23-08-21 22:21)
    ☐ embeds for playing music refer to previous TODO section

NOTES:

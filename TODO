☐ Queue control with button interaction (in testing) @started(23-08-20 18:28)
☐ Change things into embeds (start with the queue control, there is a thumbnail_url attribute for Youtube objects)
☐ Disable buttons when command is finished (like when using play command and song is stopped) @started(23-08-20 19:23)
☐ When skipping or playing queue or going back, bot needs to play the music in accordance of index (MusicControl ui.View class)
☐ incorporate the options.cfg file into stuff like default volume setting @started(23-08-20 19:22)
✔ fix object so that queue stores YouTube object, not Stream object @done(23-08-20 18:29)

NOTES:

GENERAL:
    ☐ Change things into embeds (start with the queue control, there is a thumbnail_url attribute for Youtube objects)
    ☐ only people who used the command should be able to control the music
    ☐ fix flag guess game
    ☐ async stuff as much as we can because its good [blocking](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#what-does-blocking-mean)

MUSIC:
    ☐ embeds for playing music refer to previous TODO section

NOTES:
    - soo since we are using inner and outer classes (bad idea, but we have to for the structure of the commands), we need to use different instances of "self" in order to have the inner class (ui.View) be able to use the outer class attributes (commands.Cog) send help
